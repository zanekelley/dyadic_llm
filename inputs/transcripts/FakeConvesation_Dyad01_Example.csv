A,"Hey, did you finish reading that article I sent you yesterday?"
B,"Yeah, I read it this morning. It was more interesting than I expected."
A,Same here—I didn’t think the results would be that strong.
B,Especially the part about how small changes had such a big effect.
A,Right? It makes me rethink how we designed our own study.
B,I was thinking the same thing. We might need an extra control condition.
A,"That would mean more participants, though. Do we have the budget for that?"
B,"Probably not, but we could shorten the sessions to compensate."
A,That’s a good idea. It might even reduce participant fatigue.
B,Agreed. Let’s bring it up at the meeting tomorrow.
