Speaker,Text
A,Did you hear the noise coming from the lab this morning?
B,"Yeah, I thought one of the machines was malfunctioning."
A,"I checked the logs, but everything looked normal."
B,That’s strange—maybe it was just the ventilation kicking on.
A,"Could be, although it sounded louder than usual."
B,We should probably mention it to facilities just in case.
A,Agreed. Better to be cautious than ignore a warning sign.
B,I’ll send them a message after lunch.
A,Let me know if they want more details from us.
B,Will do. Hopefully it’s nothing serious.
