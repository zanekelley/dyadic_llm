A,Are you sure the server was backed up before the update last night?
B,"I thought it was, but now I’m not seeing yesterday’s logs."
A,That’s worrying. Did the update overwrite the config files?
B,It might have. I didn’t realize the script was pointing to the old directory.
A,"Okay, let’s slow down and retrace what ran and in what order."
B,Good idea. I’ll pull the deployment history and check the timestamps.
A,"If the logs are gone, do we have anything in the cloud archive?"
B,"Possibly, but it only snapshots once every 24 hours."
A,That might still save us if the timing lines up.
B,Fingers crossed—otherwise we’re rebuilding from scratch.
